- for part 2  letter A of the practice linqpad exercise
```
A) Group employees by region and show the results in this format:
 ----------------------------------------------
 | REGION        | EMPLOYEES                  |
 ----------------------------------------------
 | Eastern       | ------------------------   |
 |               | | Nancy Devalio        |   |
 |               | | Fred Flintstone      |   |
 |               | | Bill Murray          |   |
 |               | ------------------------   |
 |---------------|----------------------------|
 | ...           |                            |
```
 - the solution is:
 ```csharp
from place in Regions
select new{
	Region = place.RegionDescription,
	Employees = (from area in place.Territories 
				 from managedTerritory in area.EmployeeTerritories
				 select managedTerritory.Employee.FirstName + " " + managedTerritory.Employee.LastName).Distinct()
}
 ```

- in order to get all of the data, go to the root (Regions) as shown in the erd, then work your way to the employees.
- Regions -> Territories -> EmployeeTerritories -> Employee.FirstName & Employee.LastName
