## Dan Talks about Linq Practice Exercises
---
```csharp
// D) List all the regions and the number of territories in each region
```

- There is a one to many relationship betweent regions and territories. Hence:

```csharp
from region in Regions
select new{
	Region_Name = region.RegionDescription,
	Territory_Count = region.Territories.Count()
}
```
---
- a "flat list" is a simple table where records can repeat and it doesn't use any objects to make it simpler??

```csharp
// E) List all the region and territory names in a "flat" list
from territory in Territories
select new{
	Region = territory.Region.RegionDescription,
	Territory = territory.TerritoryDescription
}
```

- when executed, it will show a region and which territory it belongs. Each region can be in a territory so there is a lot of repeating data.

- object graph is an object within an object

```csharp
// G) List all the product names that contain the word "chef" in the name.
from product in Products
where product.ProductName.Contains("Chef")
select product.ProductName
```

- contains is not case-sensitive for linqpad result query, but if you check the sql beside 'results' in the database it **is** case-sensitive
