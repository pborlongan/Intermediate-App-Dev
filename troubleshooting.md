- When creating listviews, do not forget to put the datakeynames, otherwise it wouldn't know what defines the entity.
- When creating objectdatasources, don't forget to connect the methods that you use for inserting, deleting, and updating.
- HOT TIP: you can move a class to its own separate file by putting your cursor at the end of the class name and pressing ctrl + .
